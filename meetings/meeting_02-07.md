# Meeting 2

* We began the meeting by talking about our research question for our project that we exited the last meeting off of:
    * Discussion started off from the original topic proposal about the two souls that Faust feels conflicting in his body
    * Rob brought up the use of Mallet in our research project
    * Islam brought up tagging linguistic elements of _Faust_ in relation to the two souls
        * For example, what adjectives show up the most in lines where Faust wants to go outside  

**Eventually, we ended up with "How does the dichotomy between Faust's two supposed souls rise and fall throughout the story"**

* We then started talking about tagging in _Faust_
    * Tagging for statements, actions, and thoughts
        * Since _Faust_ is a play, it's unlikely that we would tag thoughts separately from statements
    * We determined that lines that don't confirm to either soul would be labeled neutral
    * It's likely that structural markup will mostly resemble &lt;sp> paragraphs with &lt;line> inside
    * Do we want to tag every line with an attribute?
    * Or should we tag every sentence?
* In the end, we decided with a trial by fire:
    * Everyone marks up Scene 2: Before the City Gate with their own method**
* What specific roles will everyone do?
    * Web Design
        * Danny
        * Islam
    * XML Mark Up
        * Everyone
