# Meeting 6

* Some clean up and organization on Github
  * Fixing interpretive folder and moving the appropriate markup to it
* What are we doing during Spring Break?
  * Finish up the markup during break
    * 16 chapters of markup left
      * At least 4 each (Danny and Islam) by Monday after break
      * Islam takes 9-12, 17-20; Danny 13-16, 21-24 (There is a chapter that does not have Faust as a speaker, so whoever has it will take chapter 25)
    * Rob will continue doing interpretive markup as we upload
