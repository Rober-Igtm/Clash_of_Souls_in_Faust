# Meeting 3

* We started with what we left off of last time: discussing how we should mark up _Faust_
  * We briefly discussed if we would make up characters other than Faust
    * We decided that we would mark up _only_ Faust's lines for now
    * Marking up lines by other characters tabled for later
  * How do we mark up statements vs thoughts?
    * We will not differentiate them because of _Faust's_ status as a play
    * Statements and thoughts will appear as they are in the text: speeches and lines
* What are we naming tags, attributes, and values?
  * attribute name = "soul"
  * "soul" attribute values
    * earthly
    * divine
* What is the difference between earthly and divine?
  * earthly
  * divine
* We refined research question further
* We discussed what our graphs will look like?
* Who will be doing what (more detailed this time)?
  * Rob will mostly do the interpretive markup
  * Structural mark up with Islam
  * Danny on website design
* Goals for next week:
  * Islam will start structural mark up on _Faust_
  * Rob will start marking up _Faust_ interpretively to insert into the structural mark up later.
  * Danny will start working on the website
    * Upload a Relax NG schema for structural markup
* Questions at the end
  * Trojan tags or tagging complete lines?
    * Interpretive mark up will surround &lt;l> tags
