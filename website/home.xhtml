                    <p>Spring 2020 in HIST 1030 Computational Methods in the Humanities, this project was completed by Islam Farag, Robert Henry, and Danny Phan. Thanks and appreciation to Professor David J. Birnbaum and Project Manager Samantha Watkins for both their guidance.</p>
                    <p>This website is a platform upon which we can release our findings and research on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's <i>Faust</i>. In particular our discussion premises itself on a particular speech by Faust in Scene 2 of Part 1, where the titular character claims that there are two rivaling souls inside of him, with divergent desires that war against each other.</p>
                    <p>"One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;/
                    O, never seek to know the other!/
                    Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,/
                    And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother./
                    One with tenacious organs holds in love/
                    And clinging lust the world in its embraces;/
                    The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,/
                    Into the high ancestral spaces."</p>
                    <p>As such, our investigation into <i>Faust</i> entails a sweep through Part 1 of the text, analyzing Faust's speeches and dialogue to determine when he is acting in accordance with one of these two souls, hoping to observe the dichotomoy between the earthly and divine souls that make up his self in the process.</p>
