                <hr/>
                    <p>Broadly, across the play we see Faust begin with a strong undertaking towards divinity (the Divine soul), but falling to his Earthly (soul) passions
                    upon meeting Gretchen. The Earthly soul continues to dominate throughout their courtship, but by the end of the play his Divine soul takes back over as he attempts
                    to rescue Grethen from execution. This follows the standard narrative for how Faust has been seen to evolve. However, when looking at the deeper nuances of how
                    his souls grow and shrink throughout the play, some deeper facets of Faust's character can be understood.</p>
                    <p>In Scene VII (Street), Faust's soul alignment makes a radical flip from the previously-dominating Divine to the Earthly. </p>
