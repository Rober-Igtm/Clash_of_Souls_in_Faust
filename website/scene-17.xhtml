    MARGARET and LISBETH With pitchers.
    <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            Hast nothing heard of Barbara?<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            No, not a word. I go so little out.<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            It's true, Sibylla said, to-day.<br/>
            She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt.<br/>
            Such taking-on of airs!<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            How so?<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            It stinks!<br/>
            She's feeding two, whene'er she eats and drinks.<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            Ah!<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            And so, at last, it serves her rightly.<br/>
            She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!<br/>
            That was a promenading!<br/>
            At village and dance parading!<br/>
            As the first they must everywhere shine,<br/>
            And he treated her always to pies and wine,<br/>
            And she made a to-do with her face so fine;<br/>
            So mean and shameless was her behavior,<br/>
            She took all the presents the fellow gave her.<br/>
            'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on!<br/>
            So now, at the end, the flower is gone.<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            The poor, poor thing!<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            Dost pity her, at that?<br/>
            When one of us at spinning sat,<br/>
            And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door<br/>
            She sported with her paramour.<br/>
            On the door-bench, in the passage dark,<br/>
            The length of the time they'd never mark.<br/>
            So now her head no more she'll lift,<br/>
            But do church-penance in her sinner's shift!<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            He'll surely take her for his wife.<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade<br/>
            Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade.<br/>
            Besides, he's gone.<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>MARGARET</b>
               <p>
            That is not fair!<br/>
               </p>
    
               <br/>
               <b>LISBETH</b>
               <p>
            If him she gets, why let her beware!<br/>
            The boys shall dash her wreath on the floor,<br/>
            And we'll scatter chaff before her door!<br/>
               </p>
        [Exit]
    
    <br/>
               <b>MARGARET </b>
        (returning home)
        <p>
            How scornfully I once reviled,<br/>
            When some poor maiden was beguiled!<br/>
            More speech than any tongue suffices<br/>
            I craved, to censure others' vices.<br/>
            Black as it seemed, I blackened still,<br/>
            And blacker yet was in my will;<br/>
            And blessed myself, and boasted high,—<br/>
            And now—a living sin am I!<br/>
            Yet—all that drove my heart thereto,<br/>
            God! was so good, so dear, so true!<br/>
