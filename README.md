# Clash of Souls in _Faust_
In Goethe's _Faust_, Faust explains that he possesses two souls - one that seeks divinity, purity, and the higher powers of Nature, while the other is driven by sensual pleasures and earthly desires. This project seeks to analyze Faust's actions, thoughts, and wishes throughout Part 1 of Faust, and find which of these souls each act, thought, or wish aligns with. Our aggregate data can then show us the dynamic rise and fall of both souls' control over Faust throughout the play.

In order to get a complete understanding of Faust's character and motivations that constitute his "souls", we will record not only the acts themselves, but the predicates of these acts and the influential characters or objects that drive him to each act. We will continue to find more ways to analyze the data and paint a better "roadmap" of how Faust's souls become dominant or suppressed throught Faust.
