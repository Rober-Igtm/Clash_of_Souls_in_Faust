      <p>
        FAUST
        In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth, and now
            imprisoned! That gracious, ill-starred creature shut in a dungeon as a criminal, and
            given up to fearful torments! To this has it come! to this!—Treacherous, contemptible
            spirit, and thou hast concealed it from me!—Stand, then,—stand! Roll the devilish eyes
            wrathfully in thy head! Stand and defy me with thine intolerable presence! Imprisoned!
            In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evil spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man!
            And thou hast lulled me, meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast concealed
            from me her increasing wretchedness, and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin!
