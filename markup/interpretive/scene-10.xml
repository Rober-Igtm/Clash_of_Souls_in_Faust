            <l>God forgive my husband, yet he</l>
            <l>Hasn't done his duty by me!</l>
            <l>Off in the world he went straightway,—</l>
            <l>Left me lie in the straw where I lay.</l>
            <l>And, truly, I did naught to fret him:</l>
            <l>God knows I loved, and can't forget him!</l>

            <l>I find a box, the first resembling,</l>

            <l>We'll have our private joy thereon.</l>
            <l>And then a chance will come, a holiday,</l>
            <l>When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display,</l>

            <l>What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry?</l>
            <l>What every journeyman within his wallet spares,</l>

        <lg>
            <l>Madam, it is a grief to me;</l>
            <l>Yet, on my word, his cash was put to proper uses.</l>
            <l>Besides, his penitence was very sore,</l>
            <l>And he lamented his ill fortune all the more.</l>

    <sp>

        <lg>
            <l>I stood beside his bed of dying.</l>
            <l>'Twas something better than manure,—</l>
            <l>Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure,</l>
            <l>And found that heavier scores to his account were lying.</l>
            <l>He cried: "I find my conduct wholly hateful!</l>
            <l>To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful!</l>
            <l>Ah, the remembrance makes me die!</l>
            <l>Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!"</l>

    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>
        <lg>

    <sp>
        <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>In the last throes his senses wandered,</l>
            <l>If I such things but half can judge.</l>
            <l>He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom:</l>
            <l>First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,—</l>
            <l>For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge,</l>
            <l>And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!"</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot?</l>
            <l>My work and worry, day and night?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Not so: the memory of it touched him quite.</l>
            <l>Said he: "When I from Malta went away</l>
            <l>My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous,</l>
            <l>And such a luck from Heaven befell us,</l>
            <l>We made a Turkish merchantman our prey,</l>
            <l>That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure.</l>
            <l>Then I received, as was most fit,</l>
            <l>Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,</l>
            <l>My well-apportioned share of it."</l>

    <sp>
        <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it?</l>

        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it?</l>
            <l>A fair young damsel took him in her care,</l>
            <l>As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended;</l>
            <l>And she much love, much faith to him did bear,</l>
            <l>So that he felt it till his days were ended.</l>

            <l>Even all the misery on him cast</l>
            <l>Could not prevent his shameful way of living!</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>But see! He's dead therefrom, at last.</l>
            <l>Were I in your place, do not doubt me,</l>
            <l>I'd mourn him decently a year,</l>
            <l>And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me.</l>

            <l>There never was a sweeter fool than mine,</l>
            <l>Only he loved to roam and leave me,</l>
            <l>And foreign wenches and foreign wine,</l>
