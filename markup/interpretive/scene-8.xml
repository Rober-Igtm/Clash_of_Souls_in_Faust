            <l>There was a King in Thule,</l>
            <l>Was faithful till the grave,—</l>
            <l>To whom his mistress, dying,</l>
            <l>A golden goblet gave.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <l>Naught was to him more precious;</l>
            <l>He drained it at every bout:</l>
            <l>His eyes with tears ran over,</l>
            <l>As oft as he drank thereout.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <l>When came his time of dying,</l>
            <l>The towns in his land he told,</l>
            <l>Naught else to his heir denying</l>
            <l>Except the goblet of gold.</l>

            <l>He sat at the royal banquet</l>

            <l>Into the tide below.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <l>He saw it plunging and filling,</l>
            <l>And sinking deep in the sea:</l>
            <l>Then fell his eyelids forever,</l>
            <l>And never more drank he!</l>

            <l>I locked the press, most certainly.</l>
            <l>'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be?</l>

            <l>And here there hangs a key to fit:</l>
            <l>I have a mind to open it.</l>
            <l>What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came</l>
            <l>Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair!</l>
            <l>Rich ornaments, such as a noble dame</l>
            <l>On highest holidays might wear!</l>
            <l>How would the pearl-chain suit my hair?</l>

            <l>One has at once another air.</l>
            <l>What helps one's beauty, youthful blood?</l>
            <l>One may possess them, well and good;</l>
            <l>But none the more do others care.</l>
            <l>They praise us half in pity, sure:</l>
            <l>To gold still tends,</l>
            <l>On gold depends</l>
            <l>All, all! Alas, we poor!</l>
