            <l>All that is fine and good, to hear it so:</l>
            <l>Much the same way the preacher spoke,</l>
            <l>Only with slightly different phrases.</l>
        </lg>

        <lg>
            <l>To hear it thus, it may seem passable;</l>
            <l>And yet, some hitch in't there must be</l>
            <l>For thou hast no Christianity.</l>

        <lg>
            <l>The man who with thee goes, thy mate,</l>
            <l>Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate.</l>
            <l>In all my life there's nothing</l>
            <l>Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing,</l>
            <l>As his repulsive face has done.</l>

    <sp>

        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>I feel his presence like something ill.</l>
            <l>I've else, for all, a kindly will,</l>
            <l>But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth,</l>
            <l>The secret horror of him returneth;</l>
            <l>And I think the man a knave, as I live!</l>
            <l>If I do him wrong, may God forgive!</l>

        <lg>
            <l>Live with the like of him, may I never!</l>
            <l>When once inside the door comes he,</l>
            <l>He looks around so sneeringly,</l>
            <l>And half in wrath:</l>
            <l>One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:</l>
            <l>'Tis written on his very forehead</l>
            <l>That love, to him, is a thing abhorréd.</l>
            <l>I am so happy on thine arm,</l>
            <l>So free, so yielding, and so warm,</l>
            <l>And in his presence stifled seems my heart.</l>

        <lg>
            <l>It overcomes me in such degree,</l>
            <l>That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,</l>
            <l>I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.</l>
            <l>When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.</l>
            <l>That burns within me like a flame,</l>
