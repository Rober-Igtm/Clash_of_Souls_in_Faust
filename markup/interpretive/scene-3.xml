        <stage>(Entering, with the poodle.)</stage>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>Behind me, field and meadow sleeping,</l>
                <l>I leave in deep, prophetic night,</l>
                <l>Within whose dread and holy keeping</l>
                <l>The better soul awakes to light.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>The wild desires no longer win us,</l>
                <l>The deeds of passion cease to chain;</l>
                <l>The love of Man revives within us,</l>
                <l>The love of God revives again.</l></divine>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>Be still, thou poodle; make not such racket and riot!</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be?</l>
                <l>Behind the stove repose thee in quiet!</l></earthly>
            <divine><l>My softest cushion I give to thee.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping</l>
                <l>Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest,</l></divine>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>So now I take thee into my keeping,</l>
                <l>A welcome, but also a silent, guest.</l></divine>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>Ah, when, within our narrow chamber</l>
                <l>The lamp with friendly lustre glows,</l>
                <l>Flames in the breast each faded ember,</l>
                <l>And in the heart, itself that knows.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>Then Hope again lends sweet assistance,</l>
                <l>And Reason then resumes her speech:</l>
                <l>One yearns, the rivers of existence,</l>
                <l>The very founts of Life, to reach.</l></divine>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises,</l>
                <l>The sacred tones that my soul embrace,</l>
                <l>This bestial noise is out of place.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>We are used to see, that Man despises</l>
                <l>What he never comprehends,</l>
                <l>And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends,</l>
                <l>Finding them often hard to measure:</l>
                <l>Will the dog, like man, snarl his displeasure?</l></divine>
        </lg>
        <lg>
            <divine><l>But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,</l>
                <l>Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,</l>
                <l>And burning thirst again assail us?</l></earthly>
            <earthly><l>Therein I've borne so much probation!</l></earthly>
            <divine><l>And yet, this want may be supplied us;</l>
                <l>We call the Supernatural to guide us;</l>
                <l>We pine and thirst for Revelation,</l>
                <l>Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent,</l>
                <l>Than here, in our New Testament.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,—</l>
                <l>With honest purpose, once for all,</l>
                <l>The hallowed Original</l>
                <l>To change to my beloved German.</l></divine>

            <earthly><l>'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the Word."</l>

            <divine><l>The Word?—impossible so high to rate it;</l>
                <l>And otherwise must I translate it.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>If by the Spirit I am truly taught.</l></divine>
            <divine><l>Then thus: "In the Beginning was the Thought"</l>

            <divine><l>Is it the Thought which works, creates, indeed?</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>"In the Beginning was the Power," I read.</l></earthly>
            <divine><l>Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,</l>

            <divine><l>The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!</l>

            <divine><l>What a spectre I've harbored thus!</l></divine>
            <divine><l>He resembles a hippopotamus,</l>
                <l>With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see:</l>
