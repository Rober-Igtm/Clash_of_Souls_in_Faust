        <lg>
            <l>Hast nothing heard of Barbara?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>No, not a word. I go so little out.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>It's true, Sibylla said, to-day.</l>
            <l>She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt.</l>
            <l>Such taking-on of airs!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>How so?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>It stinks!</l>
            <l>She's feeding two, whene'er she eats and drinks.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Ah!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>And so, at last, it serves her rightly.</l>
            <l>She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!</l>
            <l>That was a promenading!</l>
            <l>At village and dance parading!</l>
            <l>As the first they must everywhere shine,</l>
            <l>And he treated her always to pies and wine,</l>
            <l>And she made a to-do with her face so fine;</l>
            <l>So mean and shameless was her behavior,</l>
            <l>She took all the presents the fellow gave her.</l>
            <l>'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on!</l>
            <l>So now, at the end, the flower is gone.</l>

    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>The poor, poor thing!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Dost pity her, at that?</l>
            <l>When one of us at spinning sat,</l>
            <l>And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door</l>
            <l>She sported with her paramour.</l>
            <l>On the door-bench, in the passage dark,</l>
            <l>The length of the time they'd never mark.</l>
            <l>So now her head no more she'll lift,</l>
            <l>But do church-penance in her sinner's shift!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>He'll surely take her for his wife.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade</l>
            <l>Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade.</l>
            <l>Besides, he's gone.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>That is not fair!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>LISBETH</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>If him she gets, why let her beware!</l>
            <l>The boys shall dash her wreath on the floor,</l>
            <l>And we'll scatter chaff before her door!</l>

        <stage>(returning home)</stage>
        <lg>
            <l>How scornfully I once reviled,</l>
            <l>When some poor maiden was beguiled!</l>
            <l>More speech than any tongue suffices</l>
            <l>I craved, to censure others' vices.</l>
            <l>Black as it seemed, I blackened still,</l>
            <l>And blacker yet was in my will;</l>
            <l>And blessed myself, and boasted high,—</l>
            <l>And now—a living sin am I!</l>
            <l>Yet—all that drove my heart thereto,</l>
            <l>God! was so good, so dear, so true!</l>
