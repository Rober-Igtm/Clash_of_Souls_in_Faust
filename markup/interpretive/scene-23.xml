            imprisoned!</divine> <divine>That gracious, ill-starred creature shut in a dungeon as a criminal, and
            given up to fearful torments!</divine> <divine>To this has it come! to this!—Treacherous, contemptible
            spirit, and thou hast concealed it from me!—Stand, then,—stand!</divine> <divine>Roll the devilish eyes
            wrathfully in thy head!</divine> <divine>Stand and defy me with thine intolerable presence!</divine> <divine>Imprisoned!
            In irretrievable misery! </divine><divine>Delivered up to evil spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man!</divine>
            <divine>And thou hast lulled me, meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast concealed
            from me her increasing wretchedness, and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin!</divine></p>
