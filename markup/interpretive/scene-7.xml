            <divine><l>By Heaven, the girl is wondrous fair!</l>
                <l>Of all I've seen, beyond compare;</l>
                <l>So sweetly virtuous and pure,</l>
                <l>And yet a little pert, be sure!</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>The lip so red, the cheek's clear dawn,</l>
                <l>I'll not forget while the world rolls on!</l></earthly>
            <earthly><l>How she cast down her timid eyes,</l>
                <l>Deep in my heart imprinted lies:</l>
                <l>How short and sharp of speech was she,</l>
                <l>Why, 'twas a real ecstasy!</l></earthly>

            <l>She, there? She's coming from confession,</l>
            <l>Of every sin absolved; for I,</l>
            <l>Behind her chair, was listening nigh.</l>
            <l>So innocent is she, indeed,</l>
            <l>That to confess she had no need.</l>
            <l>I have no power o'er souls so green.</l>

            <l>Who every flower for himself would take,</l>
            <l>And fancies there are no favors more,</l>
            <l>Nor honors, save for him in store;</l>

            <l>Your bliss is by no means so great</l>
            <l>As if you'd use, to get control,</l>
            <l>All sorts of tender rigmarole,</l>
            <l>And knead and shape her to your thought,</l>
