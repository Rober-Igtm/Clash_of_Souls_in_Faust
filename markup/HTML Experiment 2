      <h1>II. BEFORE THE CITY-GATE</h1>
      <hr/>
    (Pedestrians of all kinds come forth.)
    <br/>
      <p>
        SEVERAL APPRENTICES
        <p>
            <p>Why do you go that way?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        OTHERS
        <p>
            <p>We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE FIRST
        <p>
            <p>We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        AN APPRENTICE
        <p>
            <p>Go to the River Tavern, I should say.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        SECOND APPRENTICE
        <p>
            <p>But then, it's not a pleasant way.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE OTHERS
        <p>
            <p>And what will you?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        A THIRD
        <p>
            <p>As goes the crowd, I follow.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        A FOURTH
        <p>
            <p>Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer,</p>
            <p>The finest lasses and the best of beer,</p>
            <p>And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        A FIFTH
        <p>
            <p>You swaggering fellow, is your hide</p>
            <p>A third time itching to be tried?</p>
            <p>I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        SERVANT-GIRL
        <p>
            <p>No,—no! I'll turn and go to town again.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        ANOTHER
        <p>
            <p>We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE FIRST
        <p>
            <p>That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain.</p>
            <p>You'll have him, when and where you wander:</p>
            <p>His partner in the dance you'll be,—</p>
            <p>But what is all your fun to me?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE OTHER
        <p>
            <p>He's surely not alone to-day:</p>
            <p>He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        A STUDENT
        <p>
            <p>Deuce! how they step, the buxom wenches!</p>
            <p>Come, Brother! we must see them to the benches.</p>
            <p>A strong, old beer, a pipe that stings and bites,</p>
            <p>A girl in Sunday clothes,—these three are my delights.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER
        <p>
            <p>Just see those handsome fellows, there!</p>
            <p>It's really shameful, I declare;—</p>
            <p>To follow servant-girls, when they</p>
            <p>Might have the most genteel society to-day!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        SECOND STUDENT
        (to the First)
        <p>
            <p>Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,—</p>
            <p>Those, dressed so prettily and neatly.</p>
            <p>My neighbor's one of them, I find,</p>
            <p>A girl that takes my heart, completely.</p>
            <p>They go their way with looks demure,</p>
            <p>But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE FIRST
        <p>
            <p>No, Brother! not for me their formal ways.</p>
            <p>Quick! lest our game escape us in the press:</p>
            <p>The hand that wields the broom on Saturdays</p>
            <p>Will best, on Sundays, fondle and caress.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        CITIZEN
        <p>
            <p>He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster!</p>
            <p>Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster.</p>
            <p>How has he helped the town, I say?</p>
            <p>Things worsen,—what improvement names he?</p>
            <p>Obedience, more than ever, claims he,</p>
            <p>And more than ever we must pay!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        BEGGAR
        (sings)
        <p>
            <p>Good gentlemen and lovely ladies,</p>
            <p>So red of cheek and fine of dress,</p>
            <p>Behold, how needful here your aid is,</p>
            <p>And see and lighten my distress!</p>
            <p>Let me not vainly sing my ditty;</p>
            <p>He's only glad who gives away:</p>
            <p>A holiday, that shows your pity,</p>
            <p>Shall be for me a harvest-day!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        ANOTHER CITIZEN
        <p>
            <p>On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in,</p>
            <p>Like gossiping of war, and war's array,</p>
            <p>When down in Turkey, far away,</p>
            <p>The foreign people are a-fighting.</p>
            <p>One at the window sits, with glass and friends,</p>
            <p>And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding:</p>
            <p>And blesses then, as home he wends</p>
            <p>At night, our times of peace abiding.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THIRD CITIZEN
        <p>
            <p>Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too:</p>
            <p>Why, let them break their heads, let loose their passions,</p>
            <p>And mix things madly through and through,</p>
            <p>So, here, we keep our good old fashions!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        OLD WOMAN
        (to the Citizen's Daughter)
        <p>
            <p>Dear me, how fine! So handsome, and so young!</p>
            <p>Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you?</p>
            <p>Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongue,</p>
            <p>And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER
        <p>
            <p>Come, Agatha! I shun the witch's sight</p>
            <p>Before folks, lest there be misgiving:</p>
            <p>'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night,</p>
            <p>My future sweetheart, just as he were living.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        THE OTHER
        <p>
            <p>She showed me mine, in crystal clear,</p>
            <p>With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover:</p>
            <p>I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer,</p>
            <p>And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        SOLDIERS
        <p>
            <p>Castles, with lofty</p>
            <p>Ramparts and towers,</p>
            <p>Maidens disdainful</p>
            <p>In Beauty's array,</p>
            <p>Both shall be ours!</p>
            <p>Bold is the venture,</p>
            <p>Splendid the pay!</p>
            <p>Lads, let the trumpets</p>
            <p>For us be suing,—</p>
            <p>Calling to pleasure,</p>
            <p>Calling to ruin.</p>
            <p>Stormy our life is;</p>
            <p>Such is its boon!</p>
            <p>Maidens and castles</p>
            <p>Capitulate soon.</p>
            <p>Bold is the venture,</p>
            <p>Splendid the pay!</p>
            <p>And the soldiers go marching,</p>
            <p>Marching away!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
    FAUST AND WAGNER
    <br/>
      <p>
        FAUST
        <p>
            <p>Released from ice are brook and river</p>
                <p>By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring;</p>
                <p>The colors of hope to the valley cling,</p>
                <p>And weak old Winter himself must shiver,</p>
                <p>Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king:</p>
            <p>Whence, ever retreating, he sends again</p>
                <p>Impotent showers of sleet that darkle</p>
                <p>In belts across the green o' the plain.</p>
            <p>But the sun will permit no white to sparkle;</p>
            <p>Everywhere form in development moveth;</p>
            <p>He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth,</p>
                <p>And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red,</p>
                <p>He takes these gaudy people instead.</p>
            <p>Turn thee about, and from this height</p>
                <p>Back on the town direct thy sight.</p>
            <p>Out of the hollow, gloomy gate,</p>
                <p>The motley throngs come forth elate:</p>
                <p>Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard,</p>
                <p>To honor the Day of the Risen Lord!</p>
            <p>They feel, themselves, their resurrection:</p>
                <p>From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable;</p>
                <p>From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction;</p>
                <p>From the pressing weight of roof and gable;</p>
                <p>From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys;</p>
                <p>From the churches' solemn and reverend night,</p>
                <p>All come forth to the cheerful light.</p>
            <p>How lively, see! the multitude sallies,</p>
                <p>Scattering through gardens and fields remote,</p>
                <p>While over the river, that broadly dallies,</p>
                <p>Dances so many a festive boat;</p>
            <p>And overladen, nigh to sinking,</p>
                <p>The last full wherry takes the stream.</p>
            <p>Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking,</p>
                <p>Their clothes are colors that softly gleam.</p>
            <p>I hear the noise of the village, even;</p>
                <p>Here is the People's proper Heaven;</p>
                <p>Here high and low contented see!</p>
            <p>Here I am Man,—dare man to be!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        WAGNER
        <p>
            <p>To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters;</p>
            <p>'Tis honor, profit, unto me.</p>
            <p>But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters,</p>
            <p>Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity.</p>
            <p>This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling</p>
            <p>I hate,—these noises of the throng:</p>
            <p>They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling.</p>
            <p>And call it mirth, and call it song!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        PEASANTS, UNDER THE LINDEN-TREE
        (Dance and Song.)
        <p>
            <p>All for the dance the shepherd dressed,</p>
            <p>In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest</p>
            <p>Himself with care arraying:</p>
            <p>Around the linden lass and lad</p>
            <p>Already footed it like mad:</p>
            <p>Hurrah! hurrah!</p>
            <p>Hurrah—tarara-la!</p>
            <p>The fiddle-bow was playing.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>He broke the ranks, no whit afraid,</p>
            <p>And with his elbow punched a maid,</p>
            <p>Who stood, the dance surveying:</p>
            <p>The buxom wench, she turned and said:</p>
            <p>"Now, you I call a stupid-head!"</p>
            <p>Hurrah! hurrah!</p>
            <p>Hurrah—tarara-la!</p>
            <p>"Be decent while you're staying!"</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>Then round the circle went their flight,</p>
            <p>They danced to left, they danced to right:</p>
            <p>Their kirtles all were playing.</p>
            <p>They first grew red, and then grew warm,</p>
            <p>And rested, panting, arm in arm,—</p>
            <p>Hurrah! hurrah!</p>
            <p>Hurrah—tarara-la!</p>
            <p>And hips and elbows straying.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>Now, don't be so familiar here!</p>
            <p>How many a one has fooled his dear,</p>
            <p>Waylaying and betraying!</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>And yet, he coaxed her soon aside,</p>
            <p>And round the linden sounded wide.</p>
            <p>Hurrah! hurrah!</p>
            <p>Hurrah—tarara-la!</p>
            <p>And the fiddle-bow was playing.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        OLD PEASANT
        <p>
            <p>Sir Doctor, it is good of you,</p>
            <p>That thus you condescend, to-day,</p>
            <p>Among this crowd of merry folk,</p>
            <p>A highly-learned man, to stray.</p>
            <p>Then also take the finest can,</p>
            <p>We fill with fresh wine, for your sake:</p>
            <p>I offer it, and humbly wish</p>
            <p>That not alone your thirst is slake,—</p>
            <p>That, as the drops below its brink,</p>
            <p>So many days of life you drink!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        FAUST
        <p>
            <p>I take the cup you kindly reach,</p>
                <p>With thanks and health to all and each.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
    (The People gather in a circle about him.)
    <br/>
      <p>
        OLD PEASANT
        <p>
            <p>In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed,</p>
            <p>That now our day of joy you share,</p>
            <p>Who heretofore, in evil days,</p>
            <p>Gave us so much of helping care.</p>
            <p>Still many a man stands living here,</p>
            <p>Saved by your father's skillful hand,</p>
            <p>That snatched him from the fever's rage</p>
            <p>And stayed the plague in all the land.</p>
            <p>Then also you, though but a youth,</p>
            <p>Went into every house of pain:</p>
            <p>Many the corpses carried forth,</p>
            <p>But you in health came out again.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        FAUST
        <p>
            <p>No test or trial you evaded:</p>
                <p>A Helping God the helper aided.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        ALL
        <p>
            <p>Health to the man, so skilled and tried.</p>
            <p>That for our help he long may abide!</p>
        </p>

      <br/>
      <p>
        FAUST
        <p>
            <p>To Him above bow down, my friends,</p>
                <p>Who teaches help, and succor sends!</p>

            <p>With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou</p>
            <p>Receive the people's honest veneration!</p>
            <p>How lucky he, whose gifts his station</p>
            <p>With such advantages endow!</p>
            <p>Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation:</p>
            <p>Each asks, and presses near to gaze;</p>
            <p>The fiddle stops, the dance delays.</p>
            <p>Thou goest, they stand in rows to see,</p>
            <p>And all the caps are lifted high;</p>
            <p>A little more, and they would bend the knee</p>

            <p>A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!—</p>
                <p>Here from our wandering will we rest contented.</p>
            <p>Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone,</p>
                <p>When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented.</p>
            <p>Here, rich in hope and firm in faith,</p>
                <p>With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven,</p>
                <p>The end of that far-spreading death</p>
                <p>Entreating from the Lord of Heaven!</p>
            <p>Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem:</p>
                <p>Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit,</p>
                <p>How little now I deem,</p>
                <p>That sire or son such praises merit!</p>
            <p>My father's was a sombre, brooding brain,</p>
                <p>Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered,</p>
                <p>And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered</p>
                <p>With labor whimsical, and pain:</p>
                <p>Who, in his dusky work-shop bending,</p>
                <p>With proved adepts in company,</p>
                <p>Made, from his recipes unending,</p>
                <p>Opposing substances agree.</p>
            <p>There was a Lion red, a wooer daring,</p>
                <p>Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused,</p>
                <p>And both, tormented then by flame unsparing,</p>
                <p>By turns in either bridal chamber housed.</p>
            <p>If then appeared, with colors splendid,</p>
                <p>The young Queen in her crystal shell,</p>
                <p>This was the medicine—the patients' woes soon ended,</p>
                <p>And none demanded: who got well?</p>
            <p>Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,</p>
                <p>Among these vales and hills surrounding,</p>
                <p>Worse than the pestilence, have passed.</p>
            <p>Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;</p>
                <p>And I must hear, by all the living,</p>
                <p>The shameless murderers praised at last!</p>

            <p>Why, therefore, yield to such depression?</p>
            <p>A good man does his honest share</p>
            <p>In exercising, with the strictest care,</p>
            <p>The art bequeathed to his possession!</p>
            <p>Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth?</p>
            <p>Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee:</p>
            <p>Dost thou, as man, increase the stores of truth?</p>
            <p>Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee.</p>

            <p>O happy he, who still renews</p>
            <p>The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever!</p>
            <p>That which one does not know, one needs to use;</p>
            <p>And what one knows, one uses never.</p>
            <p>But let us not, by such despondence, so</p>
            <p>The fortune of this hour embitter!</p>
            <p>Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow,</p>
            <p>The green-embosomed houses glitter!</p>
            <p>The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;</p>
            <p>It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;</p>
            <p>Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,</p>
            <p>Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!</p>
            <p>Then would I see eternal Evening gild</p>
            <p>The silent world beneath me glowing,</p>
            <p>On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,</p>
            <p>The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.</p>
            <p>The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,</p>
            <p>Would then no more impede my godlike motion;</p>
            <p>And now before mine eyes expands the ocean</p>
            <p>With all its bays, in shining sleep!</p>
            <p>Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;</p>
            <p>The new-born impulse fires my mind,—</p>
            <p>I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,</p>
            <p>The Day before me and the Night behind,</p>
            <p>Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,—</p>
            <p>A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.</p>
            <p>Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid</p>
            <p>Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.</p>
            <p>Yet in each soul is born the pleasure</p>
            <p>Of yearning onward, upward and away,</p>
            <p>When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure,</p>
            <p>The lark sends down his flickering lay,—</p>
            <p>When over crags and piny highlands</p>
            <p>The poising eagle slowly soars,</p>
            <p>And over plains and lakes and islands</p>
            <p>The crane sails by to other shores.</p>

            <p>I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices,</p>
            <p>But never yet such impulse felt, as this is.</p>
            <p>One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look,</p>
            <p>Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:</p>
            <p>How otherwise the mental raptures bear us</p>
            <p>From page to page, from book to book!</p>
            <p>Then winter nights take loveliness untold,</p>
            <p>As warmer life in every limb had crowned you;</p>
            <p>And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old,</p>
            <p>All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you!</p>

            <p>One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;</p>
                <p>O, never seek to know the other!</p>
            <p>Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,</p>
                <p>And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.</p>
            <p>One with tenacious organs holds in love</p>
                <p>And clinging lust the world in its embraces;</p>
            <p>The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,</p>
                <p>Into the high ancestral spaces.</p>
            <p>If there be airy spirits near,</p>
                <p>'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing,</p>
                <p>Let them drop down the golden atmosphere,</p>
                <p>And bear me forth to new and varied being!</p>
            <p>Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine,</p>
                <p>To waft me o'er the world at pleasure,</p>
                <p>I would not for the costliest stores of treasure—</p>
