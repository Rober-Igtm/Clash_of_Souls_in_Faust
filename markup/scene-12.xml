            <l>Your courtesy an easy grace is;</l>

        <lg>
            <l>Yes, for our household small has grown,</l>
            <l>Yet must be cared for, you will own.</l>
            <l>We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping,</l>
            <l>The cooking, early work and late, in fact;</l>
            <l>And mother, in her notions of housekeeping,</l>
            <l>Is so exact!</l>
            <l>Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:</l>
            <l>We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:</l>
            <l>A nice estate was left us by my father,</l>
            <l>A house, a little garden near the town.</l>
            <l>But now my days have less of noise and hurry;</l>
            <l>My brother is a soldier,</l>
            <l>My little sister's dead.</l>
            <l>True, with the child a troubled life I led,</l>
            <l>Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry,</l>
            <l>So very dear was she.</l>

        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>I brought it up, and it was fond of me.</l>
            <l>Father had died before it saw the light,</l>
            <l>And mother's case seemed hopeless quite,</l>
            <l>So weak and miserable she lay;</l>
            <l>And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day.</l>
            <l>She could not think, herself, of giving</l>
            <l>The poor wee thing its natural living;</l>
            <l>And so I nursed it all alone</l>
            <l>With milk and water: 'twas my own.</l>
            <l>Lulled in my lap with many a song,</l>
            <l>It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong.</l>

    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>But surely, also, many a weary hour.</l>
            <l>I kept the baby's cradle near</l>
            <l>My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,</l>
            <l>And waking, hear.</l>
            <l>And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,</l>
            <l>And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,</l>
            <l>And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,</l>
            <l>Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;</l>
            <l>And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,</l>
            <l>Day after day, the same thing, never-ending.</l>
            <l>One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good,</l>
            <l>But then one learns to relish rest and food.</l>
