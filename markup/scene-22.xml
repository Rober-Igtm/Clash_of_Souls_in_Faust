            <l>Sons of Mieding, rest to-day!</l>
            <l>Needless your machinery:</l>

            <l>That the wedding golden be.</l>
            <l>Must fifty years be rounded:</l>

            <l>Ariel's song is heavenly-pure,</l>
            <l>His tones are sweet and rare ones:</l>

        <lg>
            <l>Little step and lofty leap</l>

            <l>Oberon, the beauteous fay,</l>

        <lg>
            <l>I only seize, with sketchy air,</l>
            <l>Some outlines of the tourney;</l>

            <l>A gray and wrinkled noddy;</l>
            <l>So I sit naked on my goat,</l>

        <lg>
            <l>How, in crowds together massed,</l>
            <l>They are jesting, shameless!</l>
            <l>They will even say, at last,</l>

            <l>Among this witches' revelry</l>
            <l>His way one gladly loses;</l>

            <l>Come on, and none shall pass us!</l>
            <l>The Blocksberg has a summit broad,</l>
            <l>Like Germany's Parnassus.</l>

        <speaker>INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>Say, who's the stiff and pompous man?</l>
            <l>He walks with haughty paces:</l>
            <l>He snuffles all he snuffle can:</l>
            <l>"He scents the Jesuits' traces."</l>

            <l>Are good to fish and sport in:</l>
            <l>And thus the pious man you see</l>
            <l>With even devils consorting.</l>

            <l>All instruments are fitting;</l>
            <l>And on the Blocksberg they erect</l>
            <l>Full many a place of meeting.</l>

        <speaker>DANCING-MASTER</speaker>
        <lg>
            <l>How each his legs in nimble trip</l>
            <l>Lifts up, and makes a clearance!</l>
            <l>The crooked jump, the heavy skip,</l>
            <l>Nor care for the appearance.</l>

        <lg>
            <l>This once, the fancy wrought in me</l>

            <l>Forsooth, if I am all I see,</l>
            <l>I must be idiotic!</l>

            <l>And grant to these their merits,</l>
            <l>Since from the devils I also may</l>

        <lg>
            <l>The flame they follow, on and on,</l>
