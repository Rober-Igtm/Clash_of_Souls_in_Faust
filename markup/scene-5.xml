            <l>He had a paunch beneath his vest</l>
            <l>Like that of Doctor Luther.</l>
            <l>The cook laid poison cunningly,</l>
            <l>And then as sore oppressed was he</l>

            <l>He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.</l>
            <l>But nothing cured his raving.</l>
            <l>He whirled and jumped, with torment mad,</l>

            <l>Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay,</l>
            <l>In the last convulsion twitching.</l>
            <l>Then laughed the murderess in her glee:</l>
