        <speaker>MARGARET FAUST</speaker>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Promise me, Henry!—</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>What I can!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>How is't with thy religion, pray?</l>
            <l>Thou art a dear, good-hearted man,</l>
            <l>And yet, I think, dost not incline that way.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender;</l>
            <l>For love, my blood and life would I surrender,</l>
            <l>And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>That's not enough: we must believe thereon.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Must we?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Would that I had some influence!</l>
        </lg> <l>Then, too, thou honorest not the Holy Sacraments.</l>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>I honor them.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Desiring no possession</l>
            <l>'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession.</l>
            <l>Believest thou in God?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>My darling, who shall dare</l>
            <l>"I believe in God!" to say?</l>
            <l>Ask priest or sage the answer to declare,</l>
            <l>And it will seem a mocking play,</l>
            <l>A sarcasm on the asker.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Then thou believest not!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance!</l>
            <l>Who dare express Him?</l>
            <l>And who profess Him,</l>
            <l>Saying: I believe in Him!</l>
            <l>Who, feeling, seeing,</l>
            <l>Deny His being,</l>
            <l>Saying: I believe Him not!</l>
            <l>The All-enfolding,</l>
            <l>The All-upholding,</l>
            <l>Folds and upholds he not</l>
            <l>Thee, me, Himself?</l>
            <l>Arches not there the sky above us?</l>
            <l>Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth?</l>
            <l>And rise not, on us shining,</l>
            <l>Friendly, the everlasting stars?</l>
            <l>Look I not, eye to eye, on thee,</l>
            <l>And feel'st not, thronging</l>
            <l>To head and heart, the force,</l>
            <l>Still weaving its eternal secret,</l>
            <l>Invisible, visible, round thy life?</l>
            <l>Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,</l>
            <l>And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,</l>
            <l>Call it, then, what thou wilt,—</l>
            <l>Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!</l>
            <l>I have no name to give it!</l>
            <l>Feeling is all in all:</l>
            <l>The Name is sound and smoke,</l>
            <l>Obscuring Heaven's clear glow.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>All that is fine and good, to hear it so:</l>
            <l>Much the same way the preacher spoke,</l>
            <l>Only with slightly different phrases.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>The same thing, in all places,</l>
            <l>All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day—</l>
            <l>Each in its language—say;</l>
            <l>Then why not I, in mine, as well?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>To hear it thus, it may seem passable;</l>
            <l>And yet, some hitch in't there must be</l>
            <l>For thou hast no Christianity.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Dear love!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>I've long been grieved to see</l>
            <l>That thou art in such company.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>How so?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>The man who with thee goes, thy mate,</l>
            <l>Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate.</l>
            <l>In all my life there's nothing</l>
            <l>Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing,</l>
            <l>As his repulsive face has done.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>I feel his presence like something ill.</l>
            <l>I've else, for all, a kindly will,</l>
            <l>But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth,</l>
            <l>The secret horror of him returneth;</l>
            <l>And I think the man a knave, as I live!</l>
            <l>If I do him wrong, may God forgive!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>There must be such queer birds, however.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Live with the like of him, may I never!</l>
            <l>When once inside the door comes he,</l>
            <l>He looks around so sneeringly,</l>
            <l>And half in wrath:</l>
            <l>One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:</l>
            <l>'Tis written on his very forehead</l>
            <l>That love, to him, is a thing abhorréd.</l>
            <l>I am so happy on thine arm,</l>
            <l>So free, so yielding, and so warm,</l>
            <l>And in his presence stifled seems my heart.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Foreboding angel that thou art!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>It overcomes me in such degree,</l>
            <l>That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,</l>
            <l>I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.</l>
            <l>When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.</l>
            <l>That burns within me like a flame,</l>
            <l>And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>There, now, is thine antipathy!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>But I must go.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Ah, shall there never be</l>
            <l>A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted,</l>
            <l>With breast to breast, and soul to soul united?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Ah, if I only slept alone!</l>
            <l>I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire;</l>
            <l>But mother's sleep so light has grown,</l>
            <l>And if we were discovered by her,</l>
            <l>'Twould be my death upon the spot!</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Thou angel, fear it not!</l>
            <l>Here is a phial: in her drink</l>
            <l>But three drops of it measure,</l>
            <l>And deepest sleep will on her senses sink.</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>What would I not, to give thee pleasure?</l>
            <l>It will not harm her, when one tries it?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker> <lg>
            <l>If 'twould, my love, would I advise it?</l>
        </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MARGARET</speaker> <lg>
            <l>Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see,</l>
            <l>I know not what compels me to thy will:</l>
            <l>So much have I already done for thee,</l>
            <l>That scarcely more is left me to fulfil.</l>

            <l>The Doctor has been catechised, 'tis plain;</l>
            <l>Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee.</l>

            <l>So loving and ineffable,—</l>
            <l>The faith alone</l>
            <l>That her salvation is,—with scruples holy</l>
            <l>Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well!</l>
