        <l>How is it? under way? and soon complete?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning?</l>
        <l>Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning:</l>
        <l>At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet.</l>
        <l>A fitter woman ne'er was made</l>
        <l>To ply the pimp and gypsy trade!</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>Tis well.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>Yet something is required from us.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>One service pays the other thus.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>We've but to make a deposition valid</l>
        <l>That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid,</l>
        <l>At Padua rest, in consecrated soil.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey</l>
        <l>thither?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>Sancta simplicitas! no need of such a toil;</l>
        <l>Depose, with knowledge or without it, either!</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan!</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>Now, there you are! O holy man!</l>
        <l>Is it the first time in your life you're driven</l>
        <l>To bear false witness in a case?</l>
        <l>Of God, the world and all that in it has a place,</l>
        <l>Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race,</l>
        <l>Have you not terms and definitions given</l>
        <l>With brazen forehead, daring breast?</l>
        <l>And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly,</l>
        <l>Knew you so much—and you'll confess it roundly!—</l>
        <l>As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire.</l>
        <l>For wilt thou not, no lover fairer,</l>
        <l>Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her,</l>
        <l>And all thy soul's devotion swear her?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>And from my heart.</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>'Tis very fine!</l>

        <l>Thine endless love, thy faith assuring,</l>
        <l>The one almighty force enduring,—</l>
        <l>Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>Hold! hold! It will!—If such my flame,</l>
        <l>And for the sense and power intense</l>
        <l>I seek, and cannot find, a name;</l>
        <l>Then range with all my senses through creation,</l>
        <l>Craving the speech of inspiration,</l>
        <l>And call this ardor, so supernal,</l>
        <l>Endless, eternal and eternal,—</l>
        <l>Is that a devilish lying game?</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <l>And yet I'm right!</l>


    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>Mark this, I beg of thee!</l>

        <l>And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever</l>
        <l>Intends to have the right, if but his</l>
        <l>tongue be clever,</l>
        <l>Will have it, certainly.</l>
        <l>But come: the further talking brings</l>
        <l>disgust,</l>
        <l>For thou art right, especially since I</l>
        <l>must.</l>
