        <line>Is no one laughing? no one drinking?</line>
        <line>I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking.</line>
        <line>To-day you're like wet straw, so tame;</line>
        <line>And usually you're all aflame.</line>

        <line>Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see,</line>

        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>A nasty song! Fie! a political song—</line>
        <line>A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore,</line>
        <line>That you have not the Roman realm to care for!</line>
        <line>At least, I hold it so much gain for me,</line>
        <line>That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be.</line>
        <line>Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope,</line>
        <line>And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope.</line>

        <line>Me by the nose she led, and now she'll lead you after.</line>
        <line>Her paramour should be an ugly gnome,</line>

    <line>Attention! Hearken now to me!</line>
    <line>Confess, Sirs, I know how to live.</line>
    <line>Enamored persons here have we,</line>
    <line>And I, as suits their quality,</line>
    <line>Must something fresh for their advantage give.</line>
    <line>Take heed! 'Tis of the latest cut, my strain,</line>
    <line>And all strike in at each refrain!</line>
    <stage>(He sings.)</stage>
    <line>There was a rat in the cellar-nest,</line>
    <line>Whom fat and butter made smoother:</line>
    <line>He had a paunch beneath his vest</line>
    <line>Like that of Doctor Luther.</line>
    <line>The cook laid poison cunningly,</line>
    <line>And then as sore oppressed was he</line>
    <line>As if he had love in his bosom.</line>
    <sp>
        <speaker>CHORUS <stage>(shouting)</stage></speaker>

        <line>As if he had love in his bosom!</line>

    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>He ran around, he ran about,</line>
        <line>His thirst in puddles laving;</line>
        <line>He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.</line>
        <line>But nothing cured his raving.</line>
        <line>He whirled and jumped, with torment mad,</line>
        <line>And soon enough the poor beast had,</line>
        <line>As if he had love in his bosom.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>CHORUS</speaker>

    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>And driven at last, in open day,</line>
        <line>He ran into the kitchen,</line>
        <line>Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay,</line>
        <line>In the last convulsion twitching.</line>
        <line>Then laughed the murderess in her glee:</line>
        <line>"Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp," said she,</line>
        <line>"As if he had love in his bosom!"</line>

        <line>The bald-pate pot-belly I have noted:</line>

        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <line>Before all else, I bring thee hither</line>
        <line>Where boon companions meet together,</line>
        <line>To let thee see how smooth life runs away.</line>
        <line>Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday:</line>
        <line>With little wit, and ease to suit them,</line>
        <line>They whirl in narrow, circling trails,</line>
        <line>Like kittens playing with their tails?</line>
        <line>And if no headache persecute them,</line>
        <line>So long the host may credit give,</line>
        <line>They merrily and careless live.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>The fact is easy to unravel,</line>
        <line>Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel:</line>
        <line>A single hour they've not been here.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear:</line>

    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>SIEBEL</speaker>

        <line>Who are the strangers, should you guess?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking,</line>
        <line>And then, as one a child's tooth draws, with cleverness,</line>
        <line>I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking.</line>
        <line>They're of a noble house, that's very clear:</line>
        <line>Haughty and discontented they appear.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>They're mountebanks, upon a revel.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>ALTMAYER</speaker>

        <line>Perhaps.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>Look out, I'll smoke them now!</line>
    </sp>

        <line>Not if he had them by the neck, I vow,</line>

        <line>FAUST Fair greeting, gentlemen!</line>
    </sp>

        <line>We passed, without a call, to-day.</line>
        <line>At our last interview, before we parted</line>
        <line>Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating</line>

        <line>If I am right, we heard the sound</line>

        <line>And truly, song must here rebound</line>
        <line>Superbly from the arches o'er us.</line>

        <line>We've just retraced our way from. Spain,</line>
        <line>The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber.</line>

        <stage>(Sings.)</stage>

        <line>There was a king once reigning,</line>
        <line>Who had a big black flea—</line>

        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest?</line>

        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES <stage>(sings)</stage></speaker>

        <line>There was a king once reigning,</line>
        <line>Who had a big black flea,</line>
        <line>And loved him past explaining,</line>
        <line>As his own son were he.</line>
        <line>He called his man of stitches;</line>
        <line>The tailor came straightway:</line>
        <line>Here, measure the lad for breeches.</line>
        <line>And measure his coat, I say!</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>But mind, allow the tailor no caprices:</line>
        <line>Enjoin upon him, as his head is dear,</line>
        <line>To most exactly measure, sew and shear,</line>
        <line>So that the breeches have no creases!</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES</speaker>

        <line>In silk and velvet gleaming</line>
        <line>He now was wholly drest—</line>
        <line>Had a coat with ribbons streaming,</line>
        <line>A cross upon his breast.</line>
        <line>He had the first of stations,</line>
        <line>A minister's star and name;</line>
        <line>And also all his relations</line>
        <line>Great lords at court became.</line>

        <line>And the lords and ladies of honor</line>
        <line>Were plagued, awake and in bed;</line>
        <line>The queen she got them upon her,</line>
        <line>The maids were bitten and bled.</line>
        <line>And they did not dare to brush them,</line>
        <line>Or scratch them, day or night:</line>
        <line>We crack them and we crush them,</line>

            you?</line>

        <line>With any—only satisfy our need.</line>

        <line>MEPHISTOPHELES <stage>(with singular gestures)</stage></line>

        <line>Grapes the vine-stem bears,</line>
        <line>Horns the he-goat wears!</line>
        <line>The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood,</line>
        <line>The wooden table gives wine as good!</line>
        <line>Into the depths of Nature peer,—</line>
        <line>Only believe there's a miracle here!</line>

        <line>Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill!</line>

    <sp>
        <speaker>ALL</speaker> (as they draw out the stoppers, and the wine which has been

    </sp>
    <sp>

        <line>ALL <stage>(sing)</stage></line>

        <line>As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel</line>

        <line>See, now, the race is happy—it is free!</line>

        <line>To leave them is my inclination.</line>

        <line>Take notice, first! their bestiality</line>

        <speaker>SIEBEL</speaker>

        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES <stage>(charming away the flame)</stage></speaker>

        <line>Be quiet, friendly element!</line>

        <stage>(To the revellers)</stage>

        <line>A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely.</line>

        <line>I think we'd better send him packing quietly.</line>

        <line>What, Sir! you dare to make so free,</line>
        <line>And play your hocus-pocus on us!</line>
    </sp>

        <line>False word and form of air,</line>

        <line>Vines? Can I trust my eyes?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>SIEBEL</speaker>

        <line>And purple grapes at hand!</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>Here, over this green arbor bending,</line>
        <line>See what a vine! what grapes depending!</line>

        <stage>(He takes SIEBEL by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally, and raise their

        <speaker>MEPHISTOPHELES <stage>(as above)</stage></speaker>

        <line>Loose, Error, from their eyes the band,</line>
        <line>And how the Devil jests, be now enlightened!</line>

        <stage>(He disappears with FAUST: the revellers start and separate.)</stage>

        <line>What happened?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>ALTMAYER</speaker>

        <line>How?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>Was that your nose I tightened?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER <stage>(to SIEBEL)</stage></speaker>

        <line>And yours that still I have in hand?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>ALTMAYER</speaker>

        <line>It was a blow that went through every limb!</line>
        <line>Give me a chair! I sink! my senses swim.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>But what has happened, tell me now?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>SIEBEL</speaker>

        <line>Where is he? If I catch the scoundrel hiding,</line>
        <line>He shall not leave alive, I vow.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>ALTMAYER</speaker>

        <line>I saw him with these eyes upon a wine-cask riding</line>
        <line>Out of the cellar-door, just now.</line>
        <line>Still in my feet the fright like lead is weighing.</line>

        <stage>(He turns towards the table.)</stage>

        <line>Why! If the fount of wine should still be playing?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>SIEBEL</speaker>

        <line>'Twas all deceit, and lying, false design!</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>FROSCH</speaker>

        <line>And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine.</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>

        <line>But with the grapes how was it, pray?</line>
    </sp>
    <sp>
        <speaker>ALTMAYER</speaker>

        <line>Shall one believe no miracles, just say!</line>
