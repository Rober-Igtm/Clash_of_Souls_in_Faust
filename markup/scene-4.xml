            <l>For now, thy vapors to dispel,</l>
            <l>I come, a squire of high degree,</l>
            <l>In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,</l>
            <l>A cloak in silken lustre swimming,</l>
            <l>A tall cock's-feather in my hat,</l>
            <l>A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,—</l>
            <l>And I advise thee, brief and flat,</l>
            <l>To don the self-same gay apparel,</l>
            <l>That, from this den released, and free,</l>

            <divine><l>This life of earth, whatever my attire,</l>

            <earthly><l>Too old am I to play with passion;</l>

            <divine><l>What from the world have I to gain?</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>Thou shalt abstain—renounce—refrain!</l></earthly>
            <earthly><l>Such is the everlasting song</l>
                <l>That in the ears of all men rings,—</l>
                <l>That unrelieved, our whole life long,</l>
                <l>Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.</l></earthly>
            <divine><l>In very terror I at morn awake,</l>
                <l>Upon the verge of bitter weeping,</l>
                <l>To see the day of disappointment break,</l>
                <l>To no one hope of mine—not one—its promise keeping:—</l>
                <l>That even each joy's presentiment</l>
                <l>With wilful cavil would diminish,</l>
                <l>With grinning masks of life prevent</l>
                <l>My mind its fairest work to finish!</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously</l>
                <l>Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:</l>
                <l>There, also, comes no rest to me,</l>
                <l>But some wild dream is sent to fray me.</l></earthly>
            <divine><l>The God that in my breast is owned</l>
                <l>Can deeply stir the inner sources;</l>
                <l>The God, above my powers enthroned,</l>
                <l>He cannot change external forces.</l></divine>
            <earthly><l>So, by the burden of my days oppressed,</l>
                <l>Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest!</l></earthly>

            <l>Then, the philosopher steps in</l>

            <l>The scholars are everywhere believers,</l>

            <l>Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:</l>
            <l>I know what science this has come to be.</l>
            <l>All rights and laws are still transmitted</l>
            <l>Like an eternal sickness of the race,—</l>
            <l>From generation unto generation fitted,</l>
            <l>And shifted round from place to place.</l>
            <l>Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry:</l>
            <l>Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee!</l>
            <l>The right born with us, ours in verity,</l>
            <l>This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry.</l>

            <l>I should not wish to see you here misguided:</l>
            <l>For, as regards this science, let me hint</l>
            <l>'Tis very hard to shun the false direction;</l>
            <l>There's so much secret poison lurking in 't,</l>
            <l>So like the medicine, it baffles your detection.</l>
            <l>Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth,</l>
            <l>And simply take your master's words for truth.</l>
            <l>On words let your attention centre!</l>
            <l>Then through the safest gate you'll enter</l>
            <l>The temple-halls of Certainty.</l>

            <l>For just where fails the comprehension,</l>
            <l>A word steps promptly in as deputy.</l>
            <l>With words 'tis excellent disputing;</l>
            <l>Systems to words 'tis easy suiting;</l>
            <l>On words 'tis excellent believing;</l>

            <l>You press and count the pulse's dances,</l>
